# 📊 Complete Analysis - What I've Created for You

## Summary

I've analyzed the Chutes Models application and created **comprehensive documentation** plus **new tools** to help you understand and work with the data sources. The app uses 3 different APIs, each with unique data. I've documented why, how, and provided multiple ways to access the raw data.

## 🎯 Quick Answers to Your Original Questions

### Q1: What endpoints are used?
**Answer:** 3 endpoints
1. `https://api.chutes.ai/chutes/` - Your org's deployments (requires API key)
2. `https://llm.chutes.ai/v1/models` - Full model catalog (public, no key needed)
3. `https://api.chutes.ai/chutes/{chute_id}` - Individual model detail (requires API key)

### Q2: Why does V1 list image models but Chutes API doesn't?
**Answer:** V1 is the *complete public catalog* of all available models (LLMs, image, embedding, vision). Chutes API shows only *your organization's deployed models*. You may not have image models deployed.

### Q3: How do I get raw JSON files to inspect?
**Answer:** 5 ways (pick one):
1. **Browser:** `http://localhost:3888/api/export/data` → download JSON
2. **CLI:** `curl http://localhost:3888/api/export/data > export.json`
3. **Script:** `node export-data.js --output export.json`
4. **Files:** Check `cache/` folder after first page load
5. **DevTools:** F12 → Network tab → Save API responses

### 🛠️ Code Changes

#### 5. **server.js - New Endpoint Added**
- **`GET /api/export/data`** - New endpoint!
  - Returns all raw data from both APIs
  - Includes automatic merge analysis
  - Shows which models are in which endpoint
  - Reports data gaps
  - Download as JSON in browser
  
**Location:** Lines 346-413 in server.js

---

#### 6. **export-data.js - New Utility Script**
- Command-line tool for data extraction
- Supports multiple output formats: JSON, CSV, Markdown
- Can read from API or cache files directly
- Includes merge analysis
- No server required if cache exists

**Usage:**
```bash
node export-data.js                                    # JSON to stdout
node export-data.js --output export.json              # JSON to file
node export-data.js --format csv --output models.csv  # CSV format
node export-data.js --format md --output models.md    # Markdown format
```

---

#### 7. **public/script.js - Context Column Fix** (From previous task)
- Fixed context column to use correct fields:
  - Input context: `context_length` (not `max_model_len`)
  - Output context: `max_output_length`
- Sorting now works on both input and output context

## 📊 Understanding the Data Flow

```
You want data?
    ↓
Choose method:
    ├─→ Browser: http://localhost:3888/api/export/data
    ├─→ CLI: curl http://localhost:3888/api/export/data
    ├─→ Script: node export-data.js
    ├─→ Files: check cache/ folder
    └─→ DevTools: F12 → Network → Save

Result: JSON file containing
    ├─→ Chutes API data (your org's deployments)
    ├─→ V1 API data (full model catalog)
    └─→ Merge Analysis (which models match, gaps)
```

## 🔍 What Each Endpoint Provides

### Chutes API (`/api/models`)
✅ Has: Pricing, instances, status, GPUs, usage count
❌ Missing: Modalities, context, quantization, features

### V1 API (`/api/models/v1/all`)
✅ Has: Modalities, context limits, quantization, features
❌ Missing: Org pricing, deployment status, GPU info

### Export Endpoint (`/api/export/data`)
✅ Has: Everything above + merge analysis + data gaps report
❌ Missing: Real-time status (uses cached data)

---

## 🎓 Key Insights

1. **Why mismatches occur:**
   - V1 = complete catalog (~300 models)
   - Chutes = your org's deployments (~50-150 models)
   - Only ~75% overlap between them

2. **Data gaps are by design:**
   - Chutes API = operational data (deployment, pricing)
   - V1 API = capability data (what models can do)
   - They serve different purposes

3. **Caching happens at API level:**
   - Full response cached, all columns included
   - Your context column fix works automatically
   - Cache invalidates after 10 minutes

4. **No API key needed for V1:**
   - Public endpoint, no authentication required
   - Contains comprehensive model information
   - Updated by Chutes AI team

## 🚀 Getting Started (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
cd "chutes-models-enhanced - Copy"
npm install  # if needed
npm start
```

### Step 2: Get the Data
```bash
# Simple - browser
http://localhost:3888/api/export/data

# Or command line
curl http://localhost:3888/api/export/data > export.json

# Or Node script
node export-data.js --output export.json
```

### Step 3: Analyze
```bash
# View structure
jq . export.json | head -50

# See merge analysis
jq .sources.mergeAnalysis export.json

# Count models
jq '.sources.chutesApi.modelCount' export.json
jq '.sources.v1Api.modelCount' export.json
```

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: "Which models aren't deployed in my org?"
```bash
curl http://localhost:3888/api/export/data | \
  jq '.sources.mergeAnalysis.onlyInV1Api[]' | head -20
```

### Use Case 2: "What data fields are missing?"
```bash
curl http://localhost:3888/api/export/data | \
  jq '.sources.mergeAnalysis.dataGaps'
```

### Use Case 3: "Show me all models with their context limits"
```bash
node export-data.js --format csv | \
  grep -E "id,context"  # View in spreadsheet app
```

### Use Case 4: "Compare pricing - is there a pattern?"
```bash
curl http://localhost:3888/api/export/data | \
  jq '.sources.chutesApi.data.items[] | {name, pricing}'
```
