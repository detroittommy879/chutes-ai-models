# Model Latency Testing Setup Complete! ðŸš€

## What I Built

I've successfully integrated a **Model Latency Testing** feature into your Chutes AI Model Explorer app. Here's what was done:

### Changes Made

1. **Added React** to the project (`package.json`)
   - React 18.3.1
   - React DOM 18.3.1
   - Vite React plugin for JSX support

2. **Updated Vite Configuration** (`vite.config.js`)
   - Added React plugin
   - Configured multiple entry points (main app + test page)
   - Fixed proxy to point to port 3888

3. **Added API Endpoint** (`server.js`)
   - New `/api/test-model` endpoint
   - Proxies requests to Chutes AI API
   - Uses API key from `.env` file (secure)
   - Returns latency and response data

4. **Created Test Page** (`public/test.html` + `public/test.jsx`)
   - React component for testing models
   - Tests top 10 models from your chutes-models.md
   - Real-time latency measurements
   - Shows actual responses from each model
   - Summary statistics (success rate, avg latency)
   - Matches the dark theme styling

5. **Updated Configuration**
   - Changed PORT to 3888 in `.env`
   - Updated README with new features

## How to Use

### Starting the App

You need TWO terminals running:

**Terminal 1 - Backend Server:**
```bash
cd "c:\2nd\Main\Git-Projects\z_aiimage\chutes-models-enhanced - Copy"
npm start
```
This runs on port 3888 and handles API requests securely.

**Terminal 2 - Frontend Dev Server:**
```bash
cd "c:\2nd\Main\Git-Projects\z_aiimage\chutes-models-enhanced - Copy"
npm run dev
```
This runs on port 5175 (or another port if occupied).

### Accessing the Pages

- **Main Model Explorer:** http://localhost:5175/
- **Latency Tester:** http://localhost:5175/test.html

### Testing Models

1. Go to http://localhost:5175/test.html
2. The API key is already configured from your `.env` file
3. Optionally modify the test prompt
4. Click "Run Tests"
5. Watch as each of the top 10 models is tested sequentially
6. See latency in milliseconds and actual responses

## Top 10 Models Being Tested

1. deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1
2. deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528
3. deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324
4. tngtech/DeepSeek-TNG-R1T2-Chimera
5. deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus
6. unsloth/gemma-3-4b-it
7. zai-org/GLM-4.5-Air
8. zai-org/GLM-4.6-FP8
9. unsloth/Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501
10. chutesai/Devstral-Small-2505

## Features

âœ… **Secure** - API key stored in `.env`, never exposed to client
âœ… **Real-time** - Watch tests run in real-time
âœ… **Latency Tracking** - Precise millisecond measurements
âœ… **Response Preview** - See actual model outputs
âœ… **Error Handling** - Shows which models fail and why
âœ… **Summary Stats** - Success rate, average latency
âœ… **Dark Mode** - Matches your existing app theme
âœ… **Sequential Testing** - Avoids rate limiting

## Currently Running

âœ… Backend Server: http://localhost:3888
âœ… Frontend Server: http://localhost:5175

Both are running in the background!

## Notes

- The test runs sequentially (one model at a time) to avoid rate limiting
- There's a 500ms delay between requests to be respectful of the API
- All files were created in the `chutes-models-enhanced - Copy` folder
- Nothing was modified outside of this folder as requested
