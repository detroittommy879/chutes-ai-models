## Key Differences from Basic Version

The basic version (`chutes-models/`) uses the public `/v1/models` endpoint which:

This enhanced version uses the `/chutes/` endpoint which:
- ‚úÖ Shows ALL models (image, video, audio, text)
- ‚úÖ Complete metadata and pricing
- ‚úÖ Instance status and GPU info
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires API key (server-side only)

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure your API key:**
   Create a `.env` file in this directory:

   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open in browser:**
