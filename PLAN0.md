add this column:
public	Boolean	Indicates if the chute is publicly accessible. - public shows up for some models at 
https://api.chutes.ai/chutes/

but if you put a chutes uuid in the url like:
https://api.chutes.ai/chutes/25f25a8a-7e77-548b-ba76-a592eab45233 
you will get much more or just different information about each model
